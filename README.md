# Cell typing_benchmark
Snakemake-based (MÃ¶lder et. al 2021)  pipeline to run individual cell typing methods and compare the accuracies of each method in a PBMC-based benchmark.

## Requirements:
`Conda` environments will be used to install some of the cell typing methods.
All R packages and Python modules will be installed via conda automatically using the pre-provided YAML file.

When running each pipeline with snakemake, make sure to use the `--use-conda` argument to install and use the correct conda environment. The list of packages that will be installed in the conda environment can be found in the YML file in the `doc` folder.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to use conda, the following R and Python packages need to be installed into your working environment:

#### R packages (R version 3.6.1)

```
optparse
SingleCellExperiment
tidyverse
e1071
Hmisc
cowplot
caret
monocle3
garnett
limma
org.Hs.eg.db
Hmisc
igraph
pheatmap
randomForest
RColorBrewer
reshape2
scran
Seurat
uwot
```

#### Python modules (Python 3.7.7)

```
N/A (Base Python only)
```

## Usage:
The benchmark consists of two pipelines: a training pipeline and a testing pipeline.

For the training pipeline, the provided `training_master.snake` snake file should be used.

Once a training run has been successfully completed, you will have the input files needed to run the latter testing pipeline. For the testing pipeline, the `testing_master.snake` snake file should be used.

Example configuration files for each Snakemake pipeline can be found in `doc`.

- `config_training_pipeline.yml`
- `config_testing_pipeline.yml`

---
To indicate the data sets that should be processed in the benchmark, a sample map is required:

```
1       sample_name_1     N       1
1       sample_name_2     N       1
```
Here, [sample_name] needs to be substituted with the name of the data sets that should be processed. Each data set should be indicated in a new line.

---

Example dry run:

- ```sh
  snakemake -s git/snake/training_master.snake --configfile git/doc/config_training_pipeline.yml -n
  ```

Example training run (assuming lsf system on cluster, replace with the according commands if used on a different system):

- ```sh
  snakemake -s git/snake/training_master.snake --configfile git/doc/config_training_pipeline.yml --cluster 'bsub -M {params.mem} -n {threads} -W {params.time} -R "rusage[mem={params.mem},scratch={params.scratch}]" -eo {params.lsferrfile} -oo {params.lsfoutfile}' -j 100 -p -k
  ```

Example testing run (assuming lsf system on cluster, replace with the according commands if used on a different system):

- ```sh
  snakemake -s git/snake/testing_master.snake --configfile git/doc/config_testing_pipeline.yml --cluster 'bsub -M {params.mem} -n {threads} -W {params.time} -R "rusage[mem={params.mem},scratch={params.scratch}]" -eo {params.lsferrfile} -oo {params.lsfoutfile}' -j 100 -p -k
  ```


## Input data:
Required input data for each data set that shall be included in the benchmark:

- RDS file containing a SCE (SingleCellExperiment) object including per-cell major and minor cell type (ground-truth) labels.

Please refer to the paragraph below for information on adding ground-truth labels to your data set. Apart from this the benchmark pipeline works on standard SCE data. Note that the default cell typing methods currently implemented in the pipeline expect normalized counts.
  
### Generating a SCE counts object with ground-truth cell type labels

Required input data:

- RDS file containing a SCE (SingleCellExperiment) object
- A *tsv* (tab-separated values) file containing a column with barcodes and a column with cell type ground-truth labels

The ground-truth *tsv* file should be formatted as follows:

- 4 columns:
  1. Barcodes (in data)
  2. Original Cell type label
  3. Standardised major cell type label
  4. Standardised minor cell type label

```
Barcode	Original_type	Major_type	Minor_type
0000e539a7dfe057f8013c9f5081b369	naive B cell	B.cells	B.cells.naive
0002078f929f37ffa735bd59379e35f7	T-helper cell	T.cells	T.cells.CD4
00032d6cd1f7c21a3ac0ffb1b0233a61	precursor B cell	B.cells	B.cells.precursor
00050b3d3f47102bd42ee12caf0f7320	cytotoxic T cell type 2	T.cells	T.cells.CD8
00065affcfb2b5b56902a4ce2cfa21aa	pro-B cell	B.cells	B.cells.precursor
000d2b88671106c8f71ab4f1586378fa	natural killer cell	NK.cells	none
0025a6ca5ecb85790da909c564508a23	T-helper cell	T.cells	T.cells.CD4
002d84f0415656febbbfaf17239cde7c	naive B cell	B.cells	B.cells.naive
002e791afa847df6290736b88435bcaf	cytotoxic T cell type 2	T.cells	T.cells.CD8
```

*Note: While the labels in the header are unimportant, a header is necessary.*
*Note: If no sub types are available, specify "none" in the column "Minor_type".*

The process of generating the list above can be automated using the `generate_ground-truth_list.py` Python script.

**Usage**: `python generate_ground-truth_list.py --original_labels metadata.txt --label_dictionary x --subtype_dictionary major_subtype_mapping.txt --output formatted_ground_truth.tsv `

Example of `--original_labels` input file:

- A 2-column tsv file consisting of a barcode column and a cell type label column.

```
0000e539a7dfe057f8013c9f5081b369	naive B cell
00032d6cd1f7c21a3ac0ffb1b0233a61	precursor B cell
000a156d3ff1f1f13f30601a6dc66e72	CD14+ monocyte type 1
```

Example of `--label_dictionary` input file:
- A 2-column tsv file with the original cell type labels and standardized cell type labels (can be the same label as the original cell type).

```
Dictionary_original     Dictionary_matched
cd14_monocytes_fastqs   Monocytes
CD14+ monocyte type 1   Monocytes
CD14+ monocyte type 2   Monocytes
CD16+ monocyte  Monocytes
cd4_t_helper_fastqs     T.cells.CD4
```


Example of `--subtype_dictionary` input file:

- A table with two columns and a header, mapping the relationship between major cell types and minor subtypes (subtypes can be "none" if no subtypes are present).

An example can be found in `marker_files/PBMC/celltype_config_PBMC.txt`. 

```
Major_type      Subtypes
Monocytes       none
T.cells T.cells.CD4,T.cells.CD8,T.cells.regulatory
```

Once the final ground-truth file has been generated, use the `add_sce_groundtruth.R` script to annotate the SCE data file with the ground-truth labels.

**Usage:** `Rscript add_sce_groundtruth.R --sce_in processed_sce.RDS --labels_in ground_truth.tsv --matched_labels --sce_out final_annotated_sce.RDS ` 

This output of this is the complete file to be used as input for the benchmark pipeline.
